Based on the comprehensive analysis and investment plan provided, which weighs the "Vision" against "Valuation" and ultimately sides with the Bear Analyst, the recommendation is clear.

The core arguments for a **SELL** are compelling:
1.  **Eroding Fundamentals**: Despite the long-term vision, current financial statements show a significant decline in Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income, with margins compressing dramatically. A P/E of 383 is unsustainable for a company experiencing such efficiency destruction.
2.  **Broken Technical Momentum**: The stock is losing short-term support (below 50-day SMA), and while the 200-day SMA is mentioned as a potential support, the rapid collapse suggests further downside. MACD and RSI indicators are also negative.
3.  **Valuation vs. Reality**: The current valuation relies heavily on future, unproven ventures like Robotaxi and Optimus. Pricing in perfection for non-existent products while the core EV business faces saturation presents an unacceptable risk profile.

The strategic actions proposed—immediate liquidation, moving capital to cash, and waiting for a significant washout before considering re-entry—are prudent given the identified risks.

Drawing from the past lessons learned, where holding onto "story stocks" despite deteriorating income statements led to significant losses, it is crucial to respect the breakdown in fundamentals and technicals. The principle that "narrative follows price, but price eventually follows profits" is paramount here. Ignoring shrinking margins due to a compelling future vision is a mistake to be avoided.

Therefore, the decision is to exit the position to preserve capital and await a more favorable risk-to-reward scenario.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
